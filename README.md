# IEEE13-optimization
To make use of the optimization features implemented in this GitHub repository for the Unified Power Controller in the IEEE 13 bus system, users can run the main file provided in the repository. The main file contains the code necessary to execute the optimization algorithm and generate the optimized results for the system.

To run the main file, users need to ensure that they have installed the required dependencies and libraries. These dependencies include Python and relevant libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. Once all the dependencies have been installed, users can execute the main file and customize the input parameters to suit their specific optimization needs.

The optimized results generated by the main file include the optimal settings for the Unified Power Controller, which can significantly improve the stability and efficiency of the power system. Users can also visualize the results using the graphs and plots generated by the code to better understand the performance of the system under different optimization scenarios.

In summary, this GitHub repository provides users with an efficient and easy-to-use platform for optimizing the performance of the Unified Power Controller for the IEEE 13 bus system. By running the main file, users can benefit from the optimization algorithm's capabilities and generate optimized results that can help improve the power system's overall performance.
