GA algorithm option is responsible of the behavior of the GA solver and the solution as well 

for example if you need to increase the speed to reach the solution, the elite gens is used but this could effect the quality of the solutions 

as well as the number of gens by decreasing the number of population or gens you can speed the processes of getting results but GA could step into local minimum 

the average distances between the generations shows if the GA get a solution but also could indicates if GA step into local minimum

constrains is introduced in many forms in the function it self as in in IEEE13 problem or as the burden of the devices or as upper and lower values for the solution.
